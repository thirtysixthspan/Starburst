DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starburst algorithm is eyetracking software aimed at tracking dark-pupil 
eye images and predicting the user's point of gaze in the scene image.

Usage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This algorithm package for eye tracking can be divided into four steps: 

- Extracts images from video. Function extract_images_from_video()

  Put eye video and scene video into the same directory. The program will ask you to read them in. 
  And then the program will extract eye and scene images from the videos and put them into ./Eye/
  and ./Scene/ respectively.

- Calibration. Function extract_calibration_from_video() 

  The user need to specify the directory which contains the /Eye and /Scene image directory. The left
  and right mouse button can be used to browse the images. When the eye is fixing at one of the calibration
  point, the user can indicat the calibration point in the scene image and indicate the start point in
  the eye image. And then the program will highlight the pupil ellipse and the corneal reflection. After
  confirmation of the user, that calibration point correspondence is added. Finally, a file (calibration.mat)
  containing the calibration data and an image (calibration.jpg) of calibration point correspondences will 
  be saved in the current directory automatically.

- Process the whole video. Function calculate_pupil_and_gaze() 

  The user need to specify the directory which contains the /Eye and /Scene image directory and the calibration
  file (calibration.mat). The user also need to eliminate bad calibration point correspondences  by click at the blue 
  cross indicating the location of the corneal reflection). And then the program will calculate the gaze location 
  in the scene image based.   

- Plot the result on the scene and eye image. Function plot_pupil_and_gaze( )

  The user need to specify the directory which contains the /Eye and /Scene image directory and the result
  file (ellipse_result.mat). The program will plot the pupil ellipse and its center on the eye image and plots 
  the gaze location in the scene image. And then these tow image form the result image saved in ./Result/ directory.
